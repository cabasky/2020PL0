1.Add some new symbols and their reading method
    /*      :   SYM_BLOCKEXPLBEG
    */      :   SYM_BLOCKEXPLEND
    //      :   SYM_LINEEXPL
    goto    :   SYM_GOTO
    else    :   SYM_ELSE
    [       :   SYM_LSQ
    ]       :   SYM_RSQ
    !       :   SYM_NOT
    ***:    :   SYM_LINETAG
    &       :   SYM_ADR
    &&      :   SYM_NOT
    ||      :   SYM_OR

2.Add the function to deal with explanation.
    An explanation can be served as a '\n' grammarly.

3.Well define the parameterlist of procedure.
    Regard mask->level as parameter num. Plan to make a chain for all procedure.
    In this meaning, the main block doesn't has parameterlist coz its level is 0.
    In other way, the address of parameter varies from -1 to -level.

4.Deal with re-defination problem.
    An identifier couldn't be same as any of previous identfier in the same block;
        If an local identfier has the same name with a global one, then any 
    call to the name refer to the local one.

    Compiler will check from parameterlist and previous identfier table.

    If a variable or a constant is redefinated, compiler will skip it.
    If a procedure is redefinated, compiler will skip its declaration but compiler
    its code.
